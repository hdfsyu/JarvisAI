# Compiling/running
these commands are for windows not linux or mac
you can compile python code using py2exe
and to run directly just type this: `python main.py` make sure u install python first
oh and u can set it up using this command `python setup.py`
also before compiling or running u gotta type these commands: `pip install pipwin` `pip install SpeechRecognition` `pip install pyttsx3` `pip install pywhatkit` `pip install datetime` `pip install wikipedia` `pip install pyjokes` `pip install wheel` `pipwin install pyaudio` thats it
